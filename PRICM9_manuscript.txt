We have performed the result we investigate formation mechanism of LPSO structure.
For that reason, We made up two senarios and assessed each step by the first principles calculations.
The two senarios are Stacking Fault initiate and Solute Ordering initiate. 

We assesed whether condensed solutions initiate Stacking Faults or not.
The peak of Mg 70 Zn 1 Y 1 graph is lower than the peek of Mg 72 graph.
So, we guessed impurities like Zn and Y are the key factors introducing Stacking Faults.

Next, we researched Interaction between the clusters and the solute atom.
The solute atom is inserted in the 1st through the 6th layer separating from the cluster or the stacking fault.
But, When Y replaces with Mg, the total energies show a monotonous decrease.
The graphs show Zn is not affected by cluster and Y is affected by cluster.
But, the Zn-Y pair is stable in the same layer.
So, Zn is stable a long distance layer from cluster or Stacking Fault too.

Then we inspect cluster stability.
We compare cluster energys about clusters in various type lattice.
The atomic configuration of the cluster in hcp lattice has not been reported, thus we made up models by sliding up-half of L12 cluster.
And, each cluster will be called type(a) and type(b).
we got a result type(a) cluster is most unstable and type(b) cluster is most stable.

We researched Interaction between cluster and Zn-Y pair.
Fixed total energies show Zn-Y pair at first layer is most stable.
But, relaxed total energies shows monotonous decrease. 
Results shows strong tendency the sweeping out from the stacking fault or cluster.

Results of our research don't support two senario we made up.
But, the results support prediction solutions are trapped Stacking Fault and initiate Stacking Fault. 

So, we modified senario.
First in modified senario, Zn and Y pair stayed in same stacking layer.
Second, Condensed Zn and Y induces Stacking Fault.
Third, Stacking Fault traps Zn and Y.
Fouth, Clusters are formed there.
Fifth, Further Zn and Y are swept out from Stacking Faults.
These steps are repeated and LPSO structures grow vertically.

But, there is possibility Stacking Fault disappear　after fourth step．
Because, result shows cluster is stable in hcp lattice.
So, we need to calculate about cluster in detail and conduct Stacking Fault changing mechanism of LPSO structure.
