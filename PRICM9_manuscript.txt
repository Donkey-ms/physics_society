Our aim is to reveal the formation mechanism of LPSO structure.
For that purpose, we made up two senarios and assessed each step by the first principles calculations.
Two senarios are the stacking fault initiation and the solute ordering initiation. 

We assesed whether condensed solute atoms initiate the stacking faults or not.
When we performed the sliding one layer from hcp stacking to fcc stacking, the peak of Mg 70 Zn 1 Y 1 graph is lower than that of Mg 72 graph.
So, we guessed impurities like Zn and Y are the accelerating factor for the introducing of the stacking faults.

Next, we researched the interaction between the L12 clusters and the solute atom.
The solute atom is inserted in the 1st through the 6th layer separating from the cluster or the stacking fault.
When Y replaces with Mg, the total energies show a monotonous decrease.
But the graphs show Zn is not affected by cluster and Y is affected by cluster.

Because the Zn-Y pair is stablilized when locating in the same layer,
Zn is stable a long distance layer from cluster or Stacking Fault too.
ここわからん．

Then we inspect cluster stability.
We compared the cluster energies in various type of lattices.
The atomic configuration of the cluster in hcp lattice has not been reported, thus we made up models by sliding of the up-half of the L12 cluster.
There are two choices of the sliding directions, called type(a) and type(b).
We got a result type(a) cluster is most unstable and type(b) cluster is most stable.

Then, we researched the interaction between the cluster and the Zn-Y pair.
Fixed total energies show Zn-Y pair at first layer is most stable.
But, relaxed total energies shows monotonous decrease. 
Results shows a strong tendency of Zn-Y pair sweeping out from the stacking fault or cluster.

Results of our research don't support two senario we made up.
But, the results support a prediction that the solute atoms are trapped Stacking Fault and initiate Stacking Fault. 

So, we modified senario.
At first, Zn and Y pair stayed in same stacking layer.
in the second, Condensed Zn and Y induces Stacking Fault.
then in the third step, stacking fault traps Zn and Y.
in the fouth, clusters are formed there.
finally, further Zn and Y are swept out from stacking faults.
These steps are repeated and LPSO structures grow vertically.

But, there is possibility Stacking Fault disappear　after fourth step．
Because, result shows cluster is stable in hcp lattice without Stacking Fault.
So, we need to calculate about cluster in detail and conduct Stacking Fault changing mechanism of LPSO structure.
