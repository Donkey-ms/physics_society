Our aim is to reveal the formation mechanism of LPSO structure.
For that purpose, we made up two senarios and assessed each step by the first principles calculations.
Two senarios are the stacking fault initiation and the solute ordering initiation. 

Next, we researched the interaction between the L12 clusters and the solute atom.
The solute atom is inserted in the 1st through the 6th layer separating from the cluster or the stacking fault.
When Y replaces with Mg, the total energies show a monotonous decrease.
But the graphs show Zn is not affected by cluster and Y is affected by cluster.

Then, we researched the interaction between the cluster and the Zn-Y pair.
Relaxed total energies shows monotonous decrease. 
Results shows a strong tendency of Zn-Y pair sweeping out from the stacking fault or cluster.

The results support a prediction that the solute atoms are trapped Stacking Fault and initiate Stacking Fault. 
But, energy changes show monotonous decrease. The results don't show the middle range ordering of the clusters.

Therefore, we pay attention to Small_Cluster.
Kiyohara et al. have reported that a L12 like cluster embedded in hcp lattice shows the unique relaxed structure which is almost split in two smaller clusters.
We call the structure Small_Cluster.
For making smaller clusters, we divide an L12  cluster vertically or horizontally like (a) or (b).
Then we insert the small cluster in hcp Mg with the 6 layers.
The first principle calculations show that (a) type cluster shows 0.2 eV lower energy than (b) type cluster.
The energy change is not a monotounous tendency but the slight minimum at the middle range of 4-5 layers.
This minimum induces the middle range ordering of the clusters.
We place Small_Cluster various positions and inspect energy change about first principle calculation.
The energy changes show same monotounous tendency.

Also, We discussed how solutions spread, and devise solutions spread mechanism by vacancy diffusion.
For revealing kinetics of the solute movement,
we calculate the stability of the vacancy around the small cluster.
We except vacancy is stable near small cluster.
But,  against exceptations,the result of calculation when vacancy is inserted far position shows low energy.
The results don't show possibility of vacancy diffusion.
So, we need to inspect again by calculating about multi-vacancies.

We modified senario.
At first, Zn and Y pair stayed in same stacking layer.
in the second, Condensed Zn and Y induces Stacking Fault.
then in the third step, stacking fault traps Zn and Y.
in the fouth, clusters are formed there.
finally, further Zn and Y are swept out from stacking faults.
These steps are repeated and LPSO structures grow vertically.











We assesed whether condensed solute atoms initiate the stacking faults or not.
When we performed the sliding one layer from hcp stacking to fcc stacking, the peak of Mg 70 Zn 1 Y 1 graph is lower than that of Mg 72 graph.
So, we guessed impurities like Zn and Y are the accelerating factor for the introducing of the stacking faults.



Then we inspect cluster stability.
We compared the cluster energies in various type of lattices.
The atomic configuration of the cluster in hcp lattice has not been reported, thus we made up models by sliding of the up-half of the L12 cluster.
There are two choices of the sliding directions, called type(a) and type(b).
We got a result type(a) cluster is most unstable and type(b) cluster is most stable.
