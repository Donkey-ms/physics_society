For revealing the kinetics of the solute movement,
we calculate the stability of the vacancies around the mini cluster.
We expect that a vacancy is stable near a mini cluster.
Against expectations, the model with a vacancy inserted at the far position 
shows the lower energy.
For confirming the denial of the possibility of the cluster diffusion,
we need to calculate on the various configurations with multi-vacancy.
